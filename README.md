There are two folders: One for the one-dimensional simulations and the other one for two-dimensional ones. Inside each folder you find three Python files, one for each of the following tasks: (_i_) Generation of the initial conditions,  (_ii_) Numerical evolution of the (non-linear) wave-type equations, and (_iii_) Plotting the Power Spectra that we obtain from the evolution.

For each simulation you have to introduce the equation that you would like to evolve, together with the time duration and the number of spatial grid points. One can also choose whether or not you would like to generate a .GIF file from the evolution data.

_IMPORTANT!_<br />
The number of the spatial grid points for the simulation must be the same as the one used to generate the initial conditions. If you would like to change the discretization,  you should first run the code to generate the initial conditions with the new number of spatial grid points.
